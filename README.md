# project-tv-script-generation
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree TV Script Generation Project

## Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in [our public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch), in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:
